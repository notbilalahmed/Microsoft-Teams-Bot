# Microsoft-Teams-Bot
This project was created with Python and Selenium to make a bot which when runs automatically opens Microsoft teams in your browser and logs in as you. As you can see by the code that this project can be used for a lot of stuff, like logging in and attending the classes for you every morning. However since this is just a skeleton of the possibilities which can be done this part of code can help you to make a bot which has endless possibilities. If there are any issues you can always send me a mail @notbilalahmed@gmail.com
